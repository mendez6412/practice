# Mapping IP Addresses w/ Go + Mapboxgl
- [Live Demo](https://selective-approval.glitch.me/)
- I wanted to explore serving filtered results from a relatively large csv file to a mapboxgl map
- This is my first run at Go and it seems pretty sweet! I like the typing a lot.

# Running Locally
- Clone the repo
- Build and start your go server (from ./rest-api run `go build` and then `./rest-api`)
- Open the .html file in your library

# TODO
- Improve searching in Go (this could be vastly improved)
- Add unit tests
- Improve file structure for FE
- UX improvements around resizing/moving the map
