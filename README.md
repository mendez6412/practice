# Mapping IP Addresses w/ Go + Mapboxgl
- I wanted to explore serving filtered results from a relatively large csv file to a mapboxgl map
- This is my first run at Go and it seems pretty sweet! I like the typing a lot.

# TODO
- Improve searching in Go (this could be vastly improved)
- Add unit tests
- Improve file structure for FE
- UX improvements around resizing/moving the map
